Riverine Odonata Study for BDS


Riverine Odonata Coding Plan

Have a spatial frame of riverine dragonfly species
Have a spatial frame of water quality data

For each water quality record, identify whether there is a dragonfly record
within 500m within 1 year?
Then have a quantitative value (water quality) to compare with a binary value.
See if dragonfly presence of these species is more likely with certain water quality values.
